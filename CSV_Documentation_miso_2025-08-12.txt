=== CSV OUTPUT FILES DOCUMENTATION ===

The generator analysis system produces multiple CSV files, each providing specific insights:

1. ENHANCED all_generators_{market}.csv
   ================================
   Source: /miso/cluster_generations.csv API + ResourceDB enhancement
   Purpose: Complete generator inventory with identification and current status
   
   Key Columns & Insights:
   - uid: Unique generator identifier

   - unit_id: EIA unit identifier (or MULTI_X_UNITS for multi-unit resources)
   - total_units: Number of units in the resource
   - multi_unit: Boolean indicating if resource has multiple units
   - label: Human-readable generator name with unit details
   - pmax: Maximum generation capacity (MW) - Design capacity limit
   - generation: Current/recent actual generation (MW) - Real-time output
   - fuel_type: Primary fuel source(s)
   - quality_tag: Data quality indicator from upstream API
     * VERY_GOOD: Fresh, complete, reliable data
     * GOOD: Generally reliable with minor gaps
     * AVERAGE: Some data quality issues
     * BAD: Significant data quality concerns
   - time_stamp: Data freshness timestamp
   
   What it teaches us:
   - Generator capacity utilization (generation/pmax ratio)
   - Data reliability for analysis purposes
   - Multi-unit vs single-unit operational patterns
   - Real-time market participation

2. generator_forecast_ranked_{market}_{date}.csv
   ===============================================
   Purpose: Comprehensive generator performance ranking and metrics
   
   Key Insights by Column:
   - performance_score (0-100): Overall forecast quality ranking
   - performance_classification: Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor/Critical
   - RMSE_over_generation: Root Mean Square Error in MW
   - rmse_percentage_of_capacity: RMSE as % of generator capacity

   - consistency_score: Forecast reliability over time
   - volatility_score: Forecast error stability
   - trend_direction: improving/stable/deteriorating
   - must_run: Operational constraint classification
   - bid_forecast_correlation: Strategic bid alignment
   
   What it teaches us:
   - Which generators consistently under/over-perform
   - Capacity-relative performance (small vs large generators)
   - Operational vs market-driven forecast errors
   - Strategic bidding alignment with forecasts

3. generator_anomaly_alerts_{market}_{date}.csv
   ==============================================
   Purpose: Generators with significant performance issues
   
   Key Insights:
   - Chronic error patterns (1+ problematic days in 2-day sliding window, 5+ days in 7-day for high severity)
   - Statistical outliers (Z-score > 2.0)
   - Performance degradation trends
   - Multi-unit coordination issues
   
   What it teaches us:
   - Generators needing immediate attention
   - Systematic vs random forecast errors
   - Operational constraint misalignment
   - Market condition sensitivity

4. forecast_alerts_{market}_{date}.csv
   ===================================
   Purpose: Actionable alerts with severity levels and recommendations
   
   Alert Types:
   - POOR_FORECAST_PERFORMANCE: General accuracy issues
   - CHRONIC_OVERFORECASTING: Persistent optimistic bias (1+ days in 2-day window, 5+ days in 7-day for high severity)
   - CHRONIC_UNDERFORECASTING: Persistent conservative bias (1+ days in 2-day window, 5+ days in 7-day for high severity)
   
   Severity Levels:
   - CRITICAL: Immediate intervention required
   - HIGH: Review within 24-48 hours
   - MEDIUM: Monitor and investigate
   - LOW: Informational tracking
   
   What it teaches us:
   - Prioritized action items for operations teams
   - Specific improvement recommendations
   - Historical error pattern context
   - Business impact assessment

5. chronic_forecast_errors_{market}_{date}.csv
   =============================================
   Purpose: Persistent forecast bias patterns
   
   Specialized Insights:
   - Duration and magnitude of chronic errors
   - Market condition correlation
   - Operational constraint violations
   - Financial impact of systematic bias
   
6. Batch Files (generator_analyzer_{market}_{batch}_{date}.csv)
   ===========================================================
   Purpose: Detailed timeseries data for deep analysis
   
   Granular Insights:
   - Hour-by-hour actual vs forecast comparison
   - Market condition correlation
   - Operational constraint binding analysis
   - Weather and demand sensitivity patterns

=== QUALITY TAG DETERMINATION ===

The quality_tag in all_generators_{market}.csv is determined by the upstream API 
(/miso/cluster_generations.csv) based on:
- Data recency (time since last update)
- Data completeness (missing data points)
- Sensor reliability scores
- Historical consistency metrics
- Communication system status

VERY_GOOD: <5 min delay, <1% missing data, high sensor reliability
GOOD: <15 min delay, <5% missing data, good sensor reliability  
AVERAGE: <60 min delay, <10% missing data, moderate sensor reliability
BAD: >60 min delay, >10% missing data, poor sensor reliability

=== ANALYSIS INSIGHTS ===

Combining these files enables:
1. Capacity factor analysis (generation/pmax trends)
2. Forecast accuracy benchmarking
3. Operational constraint identification
4. Market participation optimization
5. Revenue impact quantification
6. Predictive maintenance indicators
7. Strategic bidding improvements
